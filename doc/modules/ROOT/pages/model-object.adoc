= The model object

Models of the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/model-catalog/[GDS Model Catalog] are represented as `Model` objects in the Python client, similar to how there are xref:graph-object.adoc[graph objects].
`Model` objects are typically constructed from training a xref:pipelines.adoc[pipeline] or a xref:model-object.adoc#model-object-graphsage[GraphSAGE model], in which case a reference to the trained model in the form of a `Model` object is returned.

Once created, the `Model` objects can be passed as arguments to methods in the Python client, such as the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/model-catalog/[model catalog operations].
Additionally, the `Model` objects have convenience methods allowing for inspection of the models represented without explicitly involving the model catalog.

[[model-object-constructing]]
== Constructing a model object

There are several ways of constructing a model object.
One of the simplest is to train a https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/node-embeddings/graph-sage/[GraphSAGE] model.
Supposing we have a graph `G` that have an integer node property "price", we could do the following:

[source,python]
----
model, res = gds.beta.graphSage.train(G, modelName="my-model", featureProperties=["price"])
----

where `model` is the model object, and `res` is a pandas `Series` containing metadata from the underlying procedure call.

Similarly, we can also get model objects from training xref:pipelines.adoc[machine learning pipelines].

To get a model object that represents a model that has already been trained and is present in the model catalog, one can call the client-side only `get` method and passing it a name:

[source,python]
----
model = gds.model.get("my-model")
----

[NOTE]
====
The `get` method does not use any tier prefix because it is not associated to any tier. It only exists in the client and does not have a corresponding Cypher procedure.
====


[[model-object-inspecting]]
== Inspecting a model object

There are convenience methods on all model objects that let us extract information about the represented model.

| exists        | -                             | bool                | `True` if the model exists in the GDS Model Catalog, `False` otherwise.

|===

For example, to get the train configuration of a model object `model`, we would do the following:

[source,python]
----
train_config = model.train_config()
----


== Using a model object

The primary way to use model objects is for prediction.
How to do so for GraphSAGE is xref:model-object.adoc#model-object-graphsage[described below], and on the xref:pipelines.adoc[Machine learning pipelines] page for pipelines.

Additionally, model objects can be used as input to https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/model-catalog/[GDS Model Catalog operations].
For instance, supposing we have a model object `model`, we could:

[source,python]
----
# Store the model on disk (GDS Enterprise Edition)
_ = gds.alpha.model.store(model)

gds.beta.model.drop(model)  # same as model.drop()
----


[[model-object-graphsage]]
=== GraphSAGE

As exemplified above in xref:model-object.adoc#model-object-constructing[Constructing a model object], training a GraphSAGE model with the Python client is analogous to https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/node-embeddings/graph-sage/[its Cypher counterpart].

Once trained, in addition to the xref:model-object.adoc#model-object-inspecting[methods above], the GraphSAGE model object will have the following methods.

.GraphSAGE model methods
[opts="header",cols="5m,5m,6m,11"]
|===
| Name           | Arguments        | Return type | Description
| predict_mutate | G: Graph, +
                   config: **kwargs | Series      | https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/node-embeddings/graph-sage/#graph-sage-trained-model-example-mutate[Predict embeddings for nodes of the input graph and mutate graph with predictions].
| predict_stream | G: Graph, +
                   config: **kwargs | DataFrame   | https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/node-embeddings/graph-sage/#_stream[Predict embeddings for nodes of the input graph and stream the results].
| predict_write  | G: Graph, +
                   config: **kwargs | Series      | https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/node-embeddings/graph-sage/#graph-sage-trained-model-example-write[Predict embeddings for nodes of the input graph and write the results back to the database].
| metrics        | -                | Series      | Returns values for the metrics computed when training.
|===

Suppose then that we have a trained GraphSAGE model `gs_model` and a graph `H` for which we would like to derive node embeddings. Then we could do the following:

[source,python]
----
# Make sure our training actually converged
metrics = gs_model.metrics()
assert metrics["didConverge"]

# Predict on `H` and write embedding node properties back to the database
results = gs_model.predict_write(H, writeProperty="embedding")
assert result["nodePropertiesWritten"] == H.node_count()
----
