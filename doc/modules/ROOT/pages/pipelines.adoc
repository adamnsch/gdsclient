= Machine learning pipelines

The Python client has special support for https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/linkprediction-pipelines/link-prediction/[Link prediction pipelines] and https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/node-property-prediction/[pipelines for node property prediction].
The GDS pipelines are represented as pipeline objects.

The Python method calls to _create_ the pipelines match their Cypher counterparts exactly.
However, the rest of the pipeline functionality is deferred to methods on the pipeline objects themselves.
Once created, the `TrainingPipeline` can be passed as arguments to methods in the Python client, such as the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/pipeline-catalog/[pipeline catalog operations].
Additionally, the `TrainingPipeline` has convenience methods allowing for inspection of the pipeline represented without explicitly involving the pipeline catalog.

== Node classification

This section outlines how to use the Python client to build, configure and train a https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/node-property-prediction/nodeclassification-pipelines/node-classification/[node classification pipeline], as well as how to use the model that training produces for predictions.


=== Pipeline

The creation of the node classification pipeline is very similar to https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/node-property-prediction/nodeclassification-pipelines/config/#nodeclassification-creating-a-pipeline[how it's done in Cypher].
To create a new node classification pipeline one would make the following call:

[source,python]
----
pipe, res = gds.beta.pipeline.nodeClassification.create("my-pipe")
----

where `pipe` is a pipeline object, and `res` is a pandas `Series` containing metadata from the underlying procedure call.

To then go on to build, configure and train the pipeline we would call methods directly on the node classification pipeline object.
Below is a description of the methods on such objects:

|===

There are two main differences when comparing the methods above that map to procedures of the Cypher API:

* As the Python methods are called on the pipeline object, one does not need to provide a name when calling them.
* Configuration parameters in the Cypher calls are represented by named keyword arguments in the Python method calls.

Another difference is that the `train` Python call takes a xref:graph-object.adoc[graph object] instead of a graph name, and returns a `NCModel` xref:model-object.adoc[model object] that we can run predictions with as well as a pandas `Series` with the metadata from the training.

Please consult the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/node-property-prediction/nodeclassification-pipelines/node-classification/[node classification Cypher documentation] for information about what kind of input the methods expect.


[[pipelines-nodeclassification-pipe-example]]
==== Example

Below is a small example of how one could configure and train a very basic node classification pipeline.
Note that we don't configure splits explicitly, but rather use the default.
We suppose that the graph `G` we train on has a node property "my-class" which will be the target of our classification training.

[source,python]
----
pipe, _ = gds.beta.pipeline.nodeClassification.create("my-pipe")

# Add Degree centrality as a property step producing "rank" node properties
pipe.addNodeProperty("degree", mutateProperty="rank")

# Select our "rank" property as a feature for the model training
pipe.selectFeatures("rank")

# Verify that the features to be used in model training are what we expect
steps = pipe.feature_properties()
assert len(steps) == 1
assert steps[0]["feature"] == "rank"

# Configure the model training to do cross-validation over logistic regression
pipe.addLogisticRegression(tolerance=(0.01, 0.001))
pipe.addLogisticRegression(penalty=1.0)

# Train the pipeline targeting node property "my-class" as label and "ACCURACY" as only metric
trained_pipe_model, res = pipe.train(G, modelName="my-model", targetProperty="my-class", metrics=["ACCURACY"])
assert res["trainMillis"] >= 0
----

A model referred to as "my-model" in the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/model-catalog/[GDS Model Catalog] is produced.
In the next section we will go over how to use that model to make predictions.


=== Model

As we saw in the previous section, node classification models are created when training a node classification pipeline.
In addition to inheriting the methods common to all xref:model-object.adoc[model objects], node classification models have the following methods:

| metrics                 | -                | Series      | Returns values for the metrics specified when training, for this particular model.
|===

One can note that the predict methods are indeed very similar to https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/node-property-prediction/nodeclassification-pipelines/predict/[their Cypher counterparts].
The three main differences are that:

* They take a xref:graph-object.adoc[graph object] instead of a graph name.
* They have Python keyword arguments representing the keys of the configuration map.
* One does not have to provide a "modelName" since the xref:model-object.adoc[model object] used itself have this information.


==== Example (continued)

We now continue the xref:pipelines.adoc#pipelines-nodeclassification-pipe-example[example above] using the node classification model `trained_pipe_model` we trained there.
Suppose that we have a new graph `H` that we want to run predictions on.

[source,python]
----
# Make sure our model performed well enough on the test set
metrics = trained_pipe_model.metrics()
assert metrics["ACCURACY"]["test"] >= 0.85

# Predict on `H` and stream the results with a specific concurrency of 8
result = trained_pipe_model.predict_stream(H, concurrency=8)
assert len(results) == H.node_count()

== Node regression

This section outlines how to use the Python client to build, configure and train a https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/node-property-prediction/noderegression-pipelines/node-regression/[node regression pipeline], as well as how to use the model that training produces for predictions.


=== Pipeline

The creation of the node regression pipeline is very similar to https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/node-property-prediction/noderegression-pipelines/config/#noderegression-creating-a-pipeline[how it's done in Cypher].
To create a new node regression pipeline one would make the following call:

[source,python]
----
pipe, res = gds.alpha.pipeline.nodeRegression.create("my-pipe")
----

where `pipe` is a pipeline object, and `res` is a pandas `Series` containing metadata from the underlying procedure call.

To then go on to build, configure and train the pipeline we would call methods directly on the node regression pipeline object.
Below is a description of the methods on such objects:

|===

There are two main differences when comparing the methods above that map to procedures of the Cypher API:

* As the Python methods are called on the pipeline object, one does not need to provide a name when calling them.
* Configuration parameters in the Cypher calls are represented by named keyword arguments in the Python method calls.

Another difference is that the `train` Python call takes a xref:graph-object.adoc[graph object] instead of a graph name, and returns a `NRModel` xref:model-object.adoc[model object] that we can run predictions with as well as a pandas `Series` with the metadata from the training.

Please consult the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/node-property-prediction/noderegression-pipelines/node-regression/[node regression Cypher documentation] for information about what kind of input the methods expect.


[[pipelines-noderegression-pipe-example]]
==== Example

Below is a small example of how one could configure and train a very basic node regression pipeline.
Note that we don't configure splits explicitly, but rather use the default.
We suppose that the graph `G` we train on has a node property "my-target" which will be the target of our regression training.

[source,python]
----
pipe, _ = gds.alpha.pipeline.nodeRegression.create("my-pipe")

# Add Degree centrality as a property step producing "rank" node properties
pipe.addNodeProperty("degree", mutateProperty="rank")

# Select our "rank" property as a feature for the model training
pipe.selectFeatures("rank")

# Verify that the features to be used in model training are what we expect
steps = pipe.feature_properties()
assert len(steps) == 1
assert steps[0]["feature"] == "rank"

# Configure the model training to do cross-validation over linear regression
pipe.addLinearRegression(tolerance=(0.01, 0.001))
pipe.addLinearRegression(penalty=1.0)

# Train the pipeline targeting node property "my-target" as label and "MEAN_SQUARED_ERROR" as only metric
trained_pipe_model, res = pipe.train(G, modelName="my-model", targetProperty="my-target", metrics=["MEAN_SQUARED_ERROR"])
assert res["trainMillis"] >= 0
----

A model referred to as "my-model" in the https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/model-catalog/[GDS Model Catalog] is produced.
In the next section we will go over how to use that model to make predictions.


=== Model

As we saw in the previous section, node regression models are created when training a node regression pipeline.
In addition to inheriting the methods common to all xref:model-object.adoc[model objects], node regression models have the following methods:

.Node regression model methods
[opts="header",cols="8m,6m,4m,13"]
|===
| Name                    | Arguments        | Return type | Description
| predict_mutate          | G: Graph, +
config: **kwargs | Series      | https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/node-property-prediction/noderegression-pipelines/predict/#noderegression-pipelines-predict-examples-mutate[Predict property values for nodes of the input graph and mutate graph with predictions].
| predict_stream          | G: Graph, +
config: **kwargs | DataFrame   | https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/node-property-prediction/noderegression-pipelines/predict/#noderegression-pipelines-predict-examples-stream[Predict property values for nodes of the input graph and stream the results].
| metrics                 | -                | Series      | Returns values for the metrics specified when training, for this particular model.
|===

One can note that the predict methods are indeed very similar to https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/machine-learning/node-property-prediction/noderegression-pipelines/predict/[their Cypher counterparts].
The three main differences are that:

* They take a xref:graph-object.adoc[graph object] instead of a graph name.
* They have Python keyword arguments representing the keys of the configuration map.
* One does not have to provide a "modelName" since the xref:model-object.adoc[model object] used itself have this information.


==== Example (continued)

We now continue the xref:pipelines.adoc#pipelines-noderegression-pipe-example[example above] using the node regression model `trained_pipe_model` we trained there.
Suppose that we have a new graph `H` that we want to run predictions on.

[source,python]
----
# Make sure our model performed well enough on the test set
metrics = trained_pipe_model.metrics()
assert metrics["MEAN_SQUARED_ERROR"]["test"] <= 20.0

# Predict on `H` and stream the results with a specific concurrency of 8
result = trained_pipe_model.predict_stream(H, concurrency=8)
assert len(results) == H.node_count()
----


== The pipeline catalog

The primary way to use pipeline objects is for training models.
Additionally, pipeline objects can be used as input to https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/pipeline-catalog/[GDS Pipeline Catalog operations].
For instance, supposing we have a pipeline object `pipe`, we could:

[source,python]
----
catalog_contains_pipe = gds.beta.pipeline.exists(pipe)

gds.beta.model.drop(pipe)  # same as pipe.drop()
----

A pipeline object that has already been created and is present in the pipeline catalog can be retrieved calling the `get` method with its name:

[source,python]
----
pipeline = gds.pipeline.get("node_pipeline")
----

[NOTE]
====
The `get` method does not use any tier prefix because it is not associated to any tier. It only exists in the client and does not have a corresponding Cypher procedure.
